**That is a place where you get through Python from beginning up to the end.**

## **What can you find here? üêç**

- **[Algorithms & Data Structures](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/algorithms_and_data_structures)** - Data structures and problems discussed in "_Algorytmy w Pythonie_" by Piotr Wr√≥blewski, and problems from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms) website. This section covers topics such as text searching, sorting, usage of dynamic programming, use of greedy, and implementation of various data structures such as linked lists, databases, graphs, binary search trees, etc.

- **[Beyond the Basic Stuff](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/beyond_the_basic_stuff)** - Problems discussed in "_Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python_" by Al Sweigart. This section covers a little bit more interesting topics and best practices in Python language. We can find something out about Big-O, profiling the code, higher-order functions,  what we shouldn't do in Python, esoteric Python oddities, OOP and inheritance, including multiple inheritance (MRO - method resolution order).

- **[Different Things](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/different_things)** - Small scripts that don't fit anywhere else.

- **[Fluent Python](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/fluent_python)** - Problems discussed in "_Fluent Python. 2nd Edition_" by Luciano Ramalho. This section covers advanced topics which allow you to truly master Python skills. It covers data structures, functions as objects, object-oriented idoms, control flow and metaprogramming.
  
- **[Hacker Rank](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/hacker_rank)** - Solutions to Python tasks from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) website.
  
- **[Python Crash Course](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/python_crash_course)** - Solutions to tasks from "_Python Crash Course_" by Eric Matthes. This section includes the total basics of Python language.
  
- **[Python in Science](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/python_in_science)** - Applications of different libraries in science problems. Here we can find different problems using libraries such as Matplotlib, Numpy, Asyncio, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Bokeh, Selenium, Numba, etc.
  
- **[Useful Tips](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/useful_tips)** - Interesting "_pythonic_" solutions for small elements of code, which I've encountered.
