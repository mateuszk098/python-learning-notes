:snake: **[section_09](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/beyond_the_basic_stuff/section_09) - Esoteric Python Oddities** <br /> Notes with several examples.

:snake: **[section_14](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/beyond_the_basic_stuff/section_14) - Practice Projects** <br /> _"Tower of Hanoi"_ and _"Four in a row"_. Simple console games in accordance with clean code practices.

:snake: **[section_15](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/beyond_the_basic_stuff/section_15) - Object-Oriented Programming and Classes** <br /> Examples of classes with and without private attributes. Example of functional and objective implementation of _"Tic-Tac-Toe"_ game.

:snake: **[section_16](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/beyond_the_basic_stuff/section_16) - Object-Oriented Programming and Inheritance** <br /> Examples of class attribute, class method, static method, composition and inheritance. Extension of _"Tic-Tac-Toe"_ game with inheritance. There we have a crucial explanation of methods calling order in case of multiple inheritance (MRO - method resolution order).
