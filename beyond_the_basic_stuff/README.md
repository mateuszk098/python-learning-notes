:snake: **[Section 08](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/beyond_the_basic_stuff/section_08) - Common Python Gotchas**  
Notes on what not to do in Python.

:snake: **[Section 09](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/beyond_the_basic_stuff/section_09) - Esoteric Python Oddities**  
Notes with several examples.

:snake: **[Section 13](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/beyond_the_basic_stuff/section_13) - Measuring Performance and Big O Algorithm Analysis**  
Notes with several examples.

:snake: **[Section 14](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/beyond_the_basic_stuff/section_14) - Practice Projects**  
_"Tower of Hanoi"_ and _"Four in a row"_. Simple console games in accordance with clean code practices.

:snake: **[Section 15](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/beyond_the_basic_stuff/section_15) - Object-Oriented Programming and Classes**  
Examples of classes with and without private attributes. Example of functional and objective implementation of _"Tic-Tac-Toe"_ game.

:snake: **[Section 16](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/beyond_the_basic_stuff/section_16) - Object-Oriented Programming and Inheritance**  
Examples of class attribute, class method, static method, composition and inheritance. Extension of _"Tic-Tac-Toe"_ game with inheritance. There we have a crucial explanation of methods calling order in case of multiple inheritance (MRO - method resolution order).

:snake: **[Section 17](https://github.com/mateuszk098/python_learning_tools/tree/master/beyond_the_basic_stuff/section_17) - Pythonic OOP: Properties and Dunder Methods**  
Examples of properties which replace setter and getter methods known in other languages. Examples of dunder methods (methods with a double underscore), with which one can overload operators.
